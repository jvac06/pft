##### TensorFlow-related packages

# If you have a TF-compatible GPU and you want to enable GPU support, then
# replace tensorflow with tensorflow-gpu, and replace tensorflow-serving-api
# with tensorflow-serving-api-gpu.
# Your GPU must have CUDA Compute Capability 3.5 or higher support, and
# you must install CUDA, cuDNN and more: see tensorflow.org for the detailed
# installation instructions.
